This is a program for remembering and repeating english words

At first you should run engtrain.exe , it will create new file 
newwords.txt automatically

You can write words in newwords.txt like:

word:meaning;second meaning;third meaning;etc
second word:meaning etc

or you can add words inside program.Check it out
I haven't created grafic user interface yet,so after you run program,
you better write down "help" and this will print out all available 
commands,they all are working except "move" - it is in development yet


Use my program and follow after me on my github:
http://github.com/fcklklfc/
use my program and write comments or recommendations
GUI and new versions will be soon!
